Do it yourself 3D printed open back headphones based on the [Aurorus Borealis](https://www.aurorusaudio.com/Borealis-p133657519) headphones.

This project is based on the work of [VasilyevichDrago](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5090443). I canged the driver mount to accomodate the 50mm beryllium coated driver. The mounting system of the earcups was also changed to reduce spinning and make the slider friction easier changable.

## Materials

To build iems you need a 3D-scan of your ear. Audiologists can make an impression of your ear for a small fee. To digitalize it, either find someone with a scanner, or try scanning it using photogrammetry.

## Assembly

## From Print to finished Product

After printing I sanded the parts to 800 grit and applied satin clear coat. This results in an apperance similar to annodized aluminium.
